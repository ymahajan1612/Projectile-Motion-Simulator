# Projectile-Motion-Simulator
A projectile motion simulator created using Python and Pygame.

The user is able to create an account, and then save the range and maximum height of the projectile.
The initial values for the projectile can be adjusted through an inputs menu.
Pressing the ESC key will open the pause menu, whether the user can toggle air resistance and the velocity input method (to toggle whether they have to select a speed and angle or x and y velocities in the inputs menu)

Once the projectile has been launched, if it's off-screen the arrow keys can be used to pan the screen, and the projectile can be saved. To access saved projectiles, the user is given the option to open a "saved projectiles" menu on the main menu. 

Once the projectile has been launched, the user is able to open a calculations tab where they can view all the calculations that have been carried out since the program was started.
